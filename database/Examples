                                                    Example Programs
                                                   
                                                   
                                                   
                                              On error -1 will be return
                                              on success result will be return
                                              
                                              

create object called $conn

$conn = new Air\database\data_base_query("localhost","root","password");







To Insert value


if($conn->insert_value("database_name","table_name","name","email","mobile","name_xyz","xyz@email.domain","12345") != -1){

   echo"value inserted";

}
else{
    echo"value could not be inserted";
}








TO retrive value

if(($x = $conn->return_value("database","table_value","name")) != -1){
 
      foreach($x as $value){
           echo"$value<br />";
      }
}
else{

     echo"nothing is there";
}

it will return one dimensional array contain all names in an array 
because only name is being retriving if more field is being retrived then two dimensional array will be retrived 









Retrive value with one match   

if(($x = $conn->return_match_value("database","table_value","name","email","xyz@email.domain")) != -1){
 
      foreach($x as $value){
           echo"$value<br />";
      }
}
else{

     echo" error !! ";
}


it will give all the name in one dimensional array where email is xyz@email.domain
two or more field can be retrive in two dimensional array








Retrive value with two match   

if(($x = $conn->return_d_match_value("database","table_value","name","email","xyz@email.domain","id","345")) != -1){
 
      foreach($x as $value){
           echo"$value<br />";
      }
}
else{

     echo" error !! ";
}


it will give all the name where email is xyz@email.domain and id is 345
two or more field can be retrive in two dimensional array









To update value with one match


if(($conn->update_value("database_name","table_name","name","abc","email","xyz@email.domain")) != -1){
   echo"data updated";
}
else{
   echo" error !! ";
}

it will update name to abc where email is xyz@email.domain










To upadte value with two match

if(($conn->d_update_value("database_name","table_name","name","abc","email","xyz@email.domain","mobile","7484")) != -1){
   echo"data updated";
}
else{
   echo" error !! ";
}

it will update name to abc where email is xyz@email.domain and mobile is 7484












To delete Tuple

if(($conn->delete("database_name","table_name","email","xyz@email.domain")) != -1){
   echo"data deleted";
}
else{
   echo" error !! ";
}

it will delete data whose email is xyz@email.domain








if(($conn->delete("database_name","table_name","name","abc","email","xyz@email.domain")) != -1){
   echo"data delete";
}
else{
   echo" error !! ";
}

it will dalete data whose name is abc and email is xyz@email.domain









To Search value 


if(($x = $conn->search_value("database_name","table_name","email","name","'a%'")) != -1){

           foreach($x as $value){
                echo"$value<br />";
           }
}
else{
   echo" error !! ";
}

it will retreve all the email in one dimensional where name starts with a
two or more field can be retrive in two dimensional array










to Drop table

if(($x = $conn->drop_table("database_name","table_name")) != -1){

      echo"table droped";
}
else{
     echo" error !! ";
}









To add new field 


if(($x = $conn->add_field("database_name","table_name","email","varchar(20)")) != -1){

      echo"new field added";
}
else{
      echo" error !! ";
}






To remove field

if(($conn->remove_field("database_name","table_name","email")) != -1){

        echo"field remove";
}
else{
        echo" error !! ";
}








condition based


if(($x = $conn->search_value("database_name","table_name","email"," WHERE id > 23 AND id < 53")) != -1){

           foreach($x as $value){
                echo"$value<br />";
           }
}
else{
         echo" error !! ";
}


WHERE id > 23 AND id < 53      is a condition here

it could be any sql command used to filter result like

name GROUP BY asc 

WHERE country IN('India','japan')




join Query


if(($x = $object->join_select("database","select_field","select_field","FROM table_1 a , table_2 b WHERE a.id = b.id")) != -1){
       print_r($x);
}
else{
       echo"error";
}
select filed could be of any numbers
